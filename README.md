# [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

## React 源码的组织结构
![avatar](/imgs/mulu.png)

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* **Declarative:** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

[Learn how to use React in your own project](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html).

## Examples

We have several examples [on the website](https://facebook.github.io/react/). Here is the first one to get you started:

```js
class HelloMessage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloMessage name="John" />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```

This example will render "Hello John" into a container on the page.

You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. We recommend using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) with a [React preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-react/) to convert JSX into native JavaScript for browsers to digest.

## Installation

React is available as the `react` package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). It is also available on a [CDN](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html#using-a-cdn).

React is flexible and can be used in a variety of projects. You can create new apps with it, but you can also gradually introduce it into an existing codebase without doing a rewrite.

The recommended way to install React depends on your project. Here you can find short guides for the most common scenarios:

* [Trying Out React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html#trying-out-react)
* [Creating a Single Page Application](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html#creating-a-single-page-application)
* [Adding React to an Existing Application](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html#adding-react-to-an-existing-application)
